Implementation Guide
Now that I've created all the necessary files for deploying the Datadog agent using Ansible with CircleCI pipeline integration, let me explain how this setup works:
1. Project Structure Overview
The project is organized as follows:

ansible.cfg: Contains Ansible configuration settings
inventory/aws_ec2.yml: Dynamic inventory that uses EC2 tags to group hosts
group_vars/: Environment-specific variables for each environment
roles/datadog/: The Datadog role with all the necessary components
playbooks/deploy_datadog.yml: Main playbook for deploying the agent
.circleci/config.yml: CircleCI configuration for CI/CD pipeline

2. How the EC2 Tags Are Used
The setup uses AWS EC2 dynamic inventory to discover and group instances based on their tags:

EC2 instances with Environment:dev tag will be included in the dev group
EC2 instances with Environment:qa tag will be included in the qa group
EC2 instances with Environment:prod tag will be included in the prod group

The inventory file (aws_ec2.yml) configures this dynamic grouping, and the playbook then applies the appropriate configuration based on these groups.
3. CircleCI Workflow
The CircleCI workflow is configured to:

Validate configuration on every branch (PR or otherwise)
Deploy to dev when code is merged to the dev branch
Deploy to qa when code is merged to the qa branch
Deploy to prod when code is merged to the main branch

The pipeline ensures that:

Ansible syntax is correct
Configuration is lint-checked
Deployment happens only to the appropriate environment based on branch

4. Security Considerations
As env variable in circleci
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
DATADOG_API_KEY

CircleCI uses environment variables for AWS credentials
Permissions are properly set on the Datadog configuration files

5. Implementation Steps

Set up repository:

Clone the repository
Place all the files in their respective directories


Set up CircleCI:

Connect your repository to CircleCI
Add the following environment variables:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret key



Update your workflow:

Create branches for development, QA, and production (dev, qa, main)
Follow GitFlow or a similar workflow for PRs and branch management



Testing the Setup
To test the setup locally before pushing:
bash# Install required packages
pip install ansible ansible-lint boto3

# Check syntax
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_datadog.yml --syntax-check

# Test with specific environment (dry-run)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_datadog.yml --limit dev --check

# Deploy to specific environment
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_datadog.yml --limit dev
This implementation automatically configures the Datadog agent with appropriate settings for each environment, collects logs, and sets up various integrations based on the environment.
